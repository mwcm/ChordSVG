- double digit frets
- calculate + write hand position
- numFrets needs to be automatically increased proporional to frets spanned
  in the positions array

- split up CreateImage

- write out what is barre'd based on positions & fingerings
- constants for height & weight
   -> need to add x spacing

- chord name position / spacing could use work
- take in more parameters from <chord> attributes (size/colors/etc.)

- provide option to strictly cohere to provided numFrets?
